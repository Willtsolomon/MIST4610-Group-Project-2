## Describing our dataset


## Questions
 1. Which Boro in New York City has had the most shootings from 2006 to 2021?

 2. What are the different factors that contribute to shootings in New York City?

## Manipulations

There was an issue where there was a person who was 1022 years old. This was a mistake in the data so it was excluded. Another manipulation was filtering the data for only Brooklyn for our second question.
