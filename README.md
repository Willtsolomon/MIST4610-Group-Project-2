## Describing our dataset
Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
Where was it obtained, what are the dimensions of it (rows and columns), what are the various
columns, data types, etc. Describe it in sufficient detail so that an uninformed reader would
understand the dataset

We obtained our data from the city of New York's public database and the New York Department of Labor. 
We used two datasets. One was on shootings by Boro. The second contains information about unemployment rates in Brooklyn.
The Columns for the shooting data are:

The Columns for the unemployment data are:

Unemployment Rate








## Questions
 1. Which Boro in New York City has had the most shootings from 2006 to 2021?
 2. Brooklyn, is there a correlation between the unemployment rate and shootings?

## Manipulations

There was an issue where there was a person who was 1022 years old. This was a mistake in the data so it was excluded. Another manipulation was filtering the data for only Brooklyn for our second question.
